Journey from Odisha to Gujarat.
-----------------------------------



I set off on an unexpected journey from Odisha to Gujarat, thanks to my bigfather who arranged a ticket for me. It was my first long trip, about 1800 km away. Since my parents are pretty strict, my neighbor, who lives next door, decided to join me for company.


I'm Manoj, a young guy from Odisha. Before leaving, I introduced to my family member with you, At home, we are a total of ten, excluding my sister who's married. We also have a pet dog named Jimmy, who I love like family.

On August 17th, my train was scheduled for 8:30 pm, and the station was far from my home, so we left around 2:00 pm, giving us a relaxed four-hour ride. I missed my family, especially the four members living in Gujarat – my dad, grandma, grandpa, and my younger brother, now working at L&T.

I was heading to Gujarat to complete my Master's degree in Computer Applications (MCA). This journey not only meant traveling but also marked the beginning of a new phase in my life... 

We reached the station by 6 pm. The weather was clear at that time, but by 8 pm, a crowd had gathered with people eagerly waiting for their trains. To make the most of the time, we decided to pick up some snacks, fruits, and water bottles.After a two-hour wait, our train finally arrived.we quickly found our seats, arranged our luggage, and settled in for the journey.

On that day, my neighbor uncle and I enjoyed the train ride, chatting and laughing through the night.The train journey from Puri to Vadodara was a memorable one , The next morning, we had tea and snacks while marveling at the beautiful views outside.The view outside the window was so beautiful, and I couldn't resist capturing those moments on my phone.During our journey, my father called and shared a surprising discovery – another uncle was on the same train! This uncle, from Puri, worked in the same Gujarat company as my father.This unexpected connection added a touch of warmth to the journey.Looking around the train, I noticed people from different states, each with their own stories. We spent two and a half days on the train, sharing experiences with fellow passengers.Finally, we reached Vadodara Station, marking the end of our train adventure and the beginning of a new chapter in our lives.


Two hours later, we reached my home where my grandparents, little brother, and dad lived. After a quick shower, we are enjoying the homemade meal , rice with chicken curry prepared by my big mom, and after we are deciding to take rest some time ,that time i was called to my mom , and i informed about , we reached Vadodara Gujarat . that time i miss my country where my memorable moments i captured in Odisha .
